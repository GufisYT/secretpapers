   <div class="LaunchpadC">2020/02/01 Decided to start a Diary. Sometimes i feel like i cant do anything, or i dont want
   to do anything, that's the reason i made this. Today was a pretty good day, few lessons were annoying, but they were
 not the worst. Couple months back i got a crush on a girl that I play a lot of League with. Not too long ago we were hanging
out, and with her, it felt like home. I think i really like her, but i dont know how to say it since, recently i have
found out, that there were rumours surrouniding her and that she had a ton of boyfriends. That doesnt bother me, but what
does, is that when I asked if she ever had a boyfriend, she said no. As i said, i really would like to get with this
girl, but i wouldn't like to have a relationship with someone who doesnt want to be honest with me. But again, it was a
long time ago, and now she might trust me more, and tell about her previous relationships, or explain me why did the
rumours happened in the first place. It's currently 10:56pm, and im feeling slightly depressed about the whole mess.
 Me and her are hanging out again this Wednesday, hope i can tell her that i like her, and get a similar response.
Would also like to ask her about the rumours and explain them to me. Im now repeating myself, so I'll be ending off this
 entry by saying goodnight to anyone reading this.</div>
