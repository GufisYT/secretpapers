     <br>2020/02/01 Decided to start a Diary. Sometimes i feel like i cant do anything, or i dont want
   to do anything, that's the reason i made this. Today was a pretty good day, few lessons were annoying, but they were
 not the worst. Couple months back i got a crush on a girl that I play a lot of League with. Not too long ago we were hanging
out, and with her, it felt like home. I think i really like her, but i dont know how to say it since, recently i have
found out, that there were rumours surrouniding her and that she had a ton of boyfriends. That doesnt bother me, but what
does, is that when I asked if she ever had a boyfriend, she said no. As i said, i really would like to get with this
girl, but i wouldn't like to have a relationship with someone who doesnt want to be honest with me. But again, it was a
long time ago, and now she might trust me more, and tell about her previous relationships, or explain me why did the
rumours happened in the first place. It's currently 10:56pm, and im feeling slightly depressed about the whole mess.
 Me and her are hanging out again this Wednesday, hope i can tell her that i like her, and get a similar response.
Would also like to ask her about the rumours and explain them to me. Im now repeating myself, so I'll be ending off this
 entry by saying goodnight to anyone reading this.</br>

<br>2020/02/02 Second day of writing this diary. Had to do some research to get these lines nicely spaced out. As of writing
this it's 8:57pm. Few minutes ago was studying for my English exam. Tomorrow we also have a history exam, that i didnt yet
prepared. Dont think i will do that today. Im predicting that tomorrow will be a difficult day. 2 Exams and double the amount
of work during the PE. Things with the girl are going fine, and Im feeling better than yesterday. We re-scheduled our meeting
from Wednesday to Thursday, which is fine by me. We both think it'll be better time to chill, since Friday's lessons arent too bad.
Being with her does really mean a lot and, once again, i want to tell her how i feel around her, but i'm quite sure I will get an
answer that i wish not to get. But there's only one way to find out. Today also gained quite a bit of PP for beat saber, which
makes me a happier person. I believe I'm currently #20 in Lithuania. Just remembered, that tomorrow, we will be taking quiz
in what kind of professions we could be posibbly interested. In my opinion these kind of quizes are a bit bullshit, but sometimes
the do work. Everything else is going pretty good as well. No relatives are sick, none are dying, and cat is happy. I'll be
signing off for today, not sure what i'll be doing later in the evening, probably watch netflix. Alright take care</br>

<br>2020/02/03 Day 3 baby. Almost forgot to write this today, but here we are agane. Currently it's 10:51pm, day went not too bad.
History exam was absolutly rubbish, questions were weird and hard to understand, hopping i can get at least 60% result. English
exam was better, but you know, all tests and exams are annoying. I also climbed to #18 for beat saber scores in LT. Pretty proud
of myself. Also tried out Budget cuts, looks pretty fun so far. Tomorrow is a big day, because I have decided to finally tell
 the girl that I like her. Hope she responds the same. Tomorrow is a confusing day, since we don't really have any lessons,
or at least we shouldn't. Oh yeah I also forgot to mention monday i got myself a VR cover for my Rift. I think it's gonna be
quite useful for keeping the headset clean. PogU XQC just started streaming, and gifted bunch of subs, sadly i didnt get one.
Alright, today is a shorter entry, since i dont have much to tell, and i want to watch MrCow. Tomorrow i will either make a huge
entry, or a small one describing my rejection. Right lads, take care and goodnight!</br>

<br>2020/02/04 This one is gonna be a shorter entry. I asked if she would like to be more than friends, she said no. I respect
 her choise and I'll try to lose a crush on her as quick as possible.I know it wont be easy, but I'll try to relax and get rid
of the thoughts. I also asked her about the rumours, and I'm happy to say that they were wrong. Alright finishing the entry already, cuz
I just want to cry it out, and get some food. Till next time lads.</br>

<br>2020/02/06 Sorry that i skipped yesterday, i got to admit, i forgot. But it also was quite uneventful. Today was also quite a boring
 day. Me and few of my buddies just played For The King, League and some Rocket League. I pretty much no longer have feelings for
 the girl I talked about in my last few entries, so I'd say that's a good step towards maintaining our friendship. It's currently 11:41pm
 and I'm trying to decide if I should write these entrys on weekends, since they are usually pretty boring. I got 6 from history
 exam that i wrote, i believe, last Wednesday. Won't lie, not surprised. Dozen of minutes ago played beat saber, got tiny amount of
 pp, and you know, I'm proud of myself. Right, I don't think I have anything else to say, or at least it just doesn't come to my mind.
 I wish everyone reading this a peaceful night.</br>

 <br>2020//04/09 Wow, it's been a second since my last entry. In case anyone reads these, I was busy with school and it is just really tough for me.
 Last time i was talking about the girl, and, we are back to some what of a more than friendship. We hug, get up close, but it still feels
 distant. As previously said, she needs more time, and we talked with her about this, and we decided not to talk about feelings until we get
 comfortable with each other. I might start writting this diary once again, just to keep myself out from crying almost everyday. I've been
crying for over a month now, I'm kind of okay with it. Nah who am i trying to fool, I'm not okay with it. It hurts when i think how lonely I'm
and realising that the girl is the only who is ok about hugging me and pushing me farther from crying. It's 9:00PM and im just too lonely to think
about anything else than her. Guess.....I will go cry again. Maybe I"ll add an entry tomorrow, today I just don't feel like doing anything. Take care
  guys.</br>

 <br>2023//07/13 Pretty emotional shit right here ay? Everything changed. If you found this, I'm glad you did. Contact me on Steam, maybe we'll find a topic to talk about.</br>
