     <br>2020/02/01 Decided to start a Diary. Sometimes i feel like i cant do anything, or i dont want
   to do anything, that's the reason i made this. Today was a pretty good day, few lessons were annoying, but they were
 not the worst. Couple months back i got a crush on a girl that I play a lot of League with. Not too long ago we were hanging
out, and with her, it felt like home. I think i really like her, but i dont know how to say it since, recently i have
found out, that there were rumours surrouniding her and that she had a ton of boyfriends. That doesnt bother me, but what
does, is that when I asked if she ever had a boyfriend, she said no. As i said, i really would like to get with this
girl, but i wouldn't like to have a relationship with someone who doesnt want to be honest with me. But again, it was a
long time ago, and now she might trust me more, and tell about her previous relationships, or explain me why did the
rumours happened in the first place. It's currently 10:56pm, and im feeling slightly depressed about the whole mess.
 Me and her are hanging out again this Wednesday, hope i can tell her that i like her, and get a similar response.
Would also like to ask her about the rumours and explain them to me. Im now repeating myself, so I'll be ending off this
 entry by saying goodnight to anyone reading this.</br>
<br>2020/02/02 Second day of writing this diary. Had to do some research to get these lines nicely spaced out. As of writing
this it's 8:57pm. Few minutes ago was studying for my English exam. Tomorrow we also have a history exam, that i didnt yet
prepared. Dont think i will do that today. Im predicting that tomorrow will be a difficult day. 2 Exams and double the amount
of work during the PE. Things with the girl are going fine, and Im feeling better than yesterday. We re-scheduled our meeting
from Wednesday to Thursday, which is fine by me. We both think it'll be better time to chill, since Friday's lessons arent too bad.
Being with her does really mean a lot and, once again, i want to tell her how i feel around her, but i'm quite sure I will get an
answer that i wish not to get. But there's only one way to find out. Today also gained quite a bit of PP for beat saber, which
makes me a happier person. I believe I'm currently #20 in Lithuania. Just remembered, that tomorrow, we will be taking quiz
in what kind of professions we could be posibbly interested. In my opinion these kind of quizes are a bit bullshit, but sometimes
the do work. Everything else is going pretty good as well. No relatives are sick, none are dying, and cat is happy. I'll be
signing off for today, not sure what i'll be doing later in the evening, probably watch netflix. Alright take care</br></div>
